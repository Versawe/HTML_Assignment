            About Burundi
        </h2>
        <div id="paragraphText1">
            Burundi might look like a small speck on a map, but
            <br> because it's so densely populated it's home to many
            <br> people. Ravaged by <strong class="blueColor">civil war, massacre, and genocide,</strong>
            <br> the people of Burundi have had it rough. Two thirds of the
            <br> population live in poverty, existing on <strong class="blueColor">less than $1 a day.</strong>

            About Turame
        </h2>
        <div id="paragraphText2">
            Making a difference can be difficult, and sometimes helping people half-way around the world
            <br> seems impossible. Fortunately, there is an organization called <strong class="orangeColor">Turame</strong> that was founded to
            <br> help fight poverty in Burundi. Turame raises money to finance micro-loans for impoverished
            <br> families, widows, and refugees. Rather than give the money away, Turame works with loan
            <br> recipients to form lasting investments, to build small businesses, and to teach self-sufficiency.

            So what can I do to help?
        </h2>
        <div id="paragraphText3">
            To spread awareness and raise funds, we (a West Michigan youth group) have decided to hold a
            <br> 24-hour gaming marathon. Friends, family, and community members are welcome to come play
            <br> games in exchange for small donations. We're going to try to stream out a live video, so anyone
            <br> can join us in spirit -- feel free to donate online as well! All funds raised will be donated to Turame.
